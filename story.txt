All stories start at the beginning, the Big Bang - a giant explosion which gave birth to all the matter and energy that would someday become us. Tiny ATOMS cooked inside burning hot stars to form all the chemical elements, like hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and oxygen (O).  H and O combine to form the molecule WATER (H2O), the most essential part of life's chemistry.  Our planet EARTH was born at just the right distance from our star (the Sun) for water to stay liquid.  Not too hot, not too cold, Earthâ€™s liquid water oceans are the reason life grew here.
